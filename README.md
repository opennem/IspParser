# OpenNEM ISP Workbook Parser

![logo](https://developers.opennem.org.au/_static/logo.png)


This is a jupyter notebook used for generating JSON representations from AEMO's ISP Outlook (Excel) Workbooks.


## Documentation

This notebook is very much under development. It was originally written to read the 2022 final outlook workbooks, and has been progressively updated with the release of the 2024 draft and the 2024 final workbooks. 

As the notebook has been updated with each new release, no effort has been made to ensure backward compatibility with earlier outlook workbooks. However this will likely be a direction for future development as we'd like to be able to go back to the very first ISP outlooks.
